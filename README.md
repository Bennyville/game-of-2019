# Game Off 2019

My project for the [Game Off 2019](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2019)

## Requirements

- yarn

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/Bennyville/game-off-2019.git
cd game-off-2019
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

Your browser will then open automatically. If it doesn't, open `127.0.0.1:8080` manually.
